# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Claude Code CLI installed for Claude Code plugin usage.
- Codex CLI installed for Codex plugin usage.
- For Codex hooks, `~/.codex/config.toml` should include `hooks = true`.

## Install the Plugin

```bash
/plugin marketplace add brainbrewlabs/brainbrew-devkit
/plugin install brainbrew-devkit
```

After installation, **restart your Claude Code session** for the new hooks, agents, and chain config to take effect.

## Verify Installation

After restarting, check that the plugin is active:

```bash
/plugins
```

You should see `brainbrew-devkit` in the list.

## opencode support

brainbrew-devkit runs under [opencode](https://opencode.ai) via the [oh-my-opencode (OHO)](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode) plugin. OHO discovers Claude Code plugins from `~/.claude/plugins/` and registers their agents, skills, commands, and MCP servers inside opencode.

::: warning Prerequisite
You must install the plugin in **Claude Code** first (the [Install the Plugin](#install-the-plugin) steps above). opencode does not have its own plugin marketplace — OHO only sees brainbrew-devkit after Claude Code has installed it into `~/.claude/plugins/`.
:::

### Setup

1. **Install OHO** in your opencode config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "plugin": ["oh-my-openagent@latest"]
   }
   ```

2. **Install brainbrew-devkit through Claude Code** as shown above. OHO will surface its agents, skills, and MCP tools (`chain_run`, `template_bump`, etc.) inside opencode automatically.

3. **Run the `init` MCP tool** to register hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`. From inside opencode (or Claude Code), invoke the brainbrew MCP:

   ```
   mcp__plugin_brainbrew-devkit_brainbrew__init
   ```

   or in chat: *"run brainbrew init"*. The tool writes hook entries with absolute paths to the plugin's `runner.cjs`, so opencode's lack of `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` env propagation is not a problem.

   This step is required for opencode. OHO's `claude-code-hooks` plugin only dispatches hooks declared in `~/.claude/settings.json` — it does **not** dispatch hooks shipped inside plugin manifests. Without this step, chain routing (PostToolUse → next agent) will not fire under opencode even though the plugin is installed.

4. **Restart opencode** so the new hook entries are picked up.

::: tip
Claude Code reads hooks directly from the plugin manifest, so you don't need `brainbrew init` for Claude Code — only for opencode.
:::

## Codex Support

brainbrew-devkit also supports Codex with curated plugin skills, plugin-declared hooks and MCP metadata, global hooks, global skills, and workflow recipe guidance. Codex does not run Claude's automatic subagent lifecycle, so BrainBrew chains are projected as Codex-safe skills and recipes.

### Prerequisites

- The brainbrew package/plugin is available locally.
- Codex has a config file at `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- `hooks = true` is enabled in that config.
- `plugin_hooks = false` is acceptable because BrainBrew writes supported hooks to `~/.codex/hooks.json`.

### Setup

Install the BrainBrew plugin from the Codex marketplace:

```
/plugins marketplace add brainbrewlabs/brainbrew-devkit
/plugins install brainbrew-devkit
```

Then enable BrainBrew's Codex runtime support:

```bash
brainbrew codex init
brainbrew codex sync-brainbrew-skills
brainbrew codex status
```

`brainbrew codex init` merges BrainBrew-owned hook entries into `~/.codex/hooks.json` and preserves unrelated user hooks. `brainbrew codex sync-brainbrew-skills` writes BrainBrew-owned workflow, role, template, and helper skills to `~/.codex/skills`, because Codex active skills are global rather than plugin-local.

The Codex plugin manifest intentionally declares only supported Codex plugin fields. Use the shell commands above for setup and diagnostics; slash prompt commands such as `/brainbrew:init` are not part of the current public Codex plugin surface.

BrainBrew DevKit does not perform generic Claude Code or OpenCode migration. For generic Claude Code to Codex migration, use OpenAI's curated `migrate-to-codex` skill. BrainBrew Codex CLI commands only install and validate BrainBrew-owned workflow and runtime assets.

### MCP

BrainBrew packages a dedicated Codex-safe MCP server in `plugin-codex/mcp/mcp-server.cjs`, declares it through `plugin-codex/mcp/mcp-servers.json`, and keeps Claude/opencode MCP metadata in `plugin/.mcp.json`. The Codex server does not expose Claude/opencode setup tools such as the shared `init` MCP tool.

Current Codex builds may install plugin MCP metadata without auto-registering it into the active MCP registry. Check whether Codex loaded the plugin MCP server:

```bash
codex mcp list
```

If `brainbrew` is missing, register the installed Codex plugin server explicitly:

```bash
codex mcp add brainbrew -- node <installed-codex-plugin-root>/mcp/mcp-server.cjs
codex mcp list
```

`Auth: Unsupported` is expected for BrainBrew's local stdio MCP server as long as `Status` is `enabled`.

For local development from this repository, use `./plugin-codex/mcp/mcp-server.cjs`.
